Speedle accepts authorization requests (that is, who can do what in what context), evaluates the applicable policies, and then returns a GRANT/DENY decision using the authorization decision service. Let's take a quick tour of how to use Speedle"

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install the Go programming language

The minimum version required is 1.13.

See https://golang.org/doc/install

If you use Oracle Linux, simply run one of below commmands.
```bash
$ sudo yum install -y oracle-golang-release-el7
$ sudo yum install -y golang
```

### 2. Set the Go environment variables

`GOROOT` is the folder where you installed Go.  
`GOPATH` is the folder where your Go projects are stored.

```bash
$ export GOROOT=/scratch/tools/go
$ export GOPATH=/scratch/xuwwang/go
```


## Download Source Code and Build Speedle

```bash
$ go get github.com/teramoby/speedle-plus/cmd/...
$ ls $GOPATH/bin
spctl  speedle-ads  speedle-pms
```

Three binary files are generated in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory:

- spctl - Speedle command line interface
- speedle-pms - Speedle policy management service
- speedle-ads - Speedle authorization decision service

## Run Speedle

### 1. Start the Policy Management Service

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/bin
$ ./speedle-pms --store-type file
```

Note: A default policy store file is created at `/tmp/speedle-test-file-store.json`.

### 2. Create policies using spctl

2.1.  Create a service container for the authorization and role policies.

```bash
$ ./spctl create service mysvc
```

2.2. Create authorization policies in the mysvc service.

```bash
$ ./spctl create policy -c "grant user user1 get,del res1" --service-name=mysvc
$ ./spctl create policy -c "grant role role2 get,del res2" --service-name=mysvc
```

2.3. Create a role policy in the mysvc service.

```bash
$ ./spctl create rolepolicy -c "grant user user2 role2 on res2" --service-name=mysvc
```

2.4. List all services

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/bin
$ ./spctl get service --all
```

The content of service mysvc displays.

### 3. Start the Authorization Decision Service

```bash
$ ./speedle-ads --store-type file
```

### 4. Verify the authorization result

To see the policies you defined take effect, run these commands in a separate command window:

```bash
$ curl -X POST --data '{"subject":{"principals":[{"type":"user","name":"user1"}]},"serviceName":"mysvc","resource":"res1","action":"get"}' http://127.0.0.1:6734/authz-check/v1/is-allowed

$ curl -X POST --data '{"subject":{"principals":[{"type":"user","name":"user2"}]},"serviceName":"mysvc","resource":"res2","action":"get"}' http://127.0.0.1:6734/authz-check/v1/is-allowed
```

The result for both commands is allowed:true.
