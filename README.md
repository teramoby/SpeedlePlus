# Speedle+

Speedle+ is a general purpose authorization engine. It allows users to construct their policy model with user-friendly policy definition language and get authorization decision in milliseconds based on the policies. Speedle is very user-friendly, efficient, and extremely scalable. 

Speedle+ open source project consits of a policy definition language, policy management module, authorization runtime module, commandline tool, and integration samples with popular systems.

Speedle+ is based on Speedle open source project which is hosted at https://github.com/oracle/speedle under UPL.
